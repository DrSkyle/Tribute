                    Around 1928 Tsushima edited a series of student publications
                    and contributed some of his own works and became a staff
                    member of the college's newspaper team. Tsushima's success
                    in writing was brought to a halt when his idol, the writer
                    Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, committed suicide in 1927. Tsushima
                    started to neglect his studies, and spent the majority of
                    his allowance on clothes, alcohol, and prostitutes Tsushima
                    attempted <span class="style-text-basic">suicide</span> by
                    drowning off a beach in Kamakura with another woman,
                    19-year-old bar hostess Shimeko Tanabe (Tanabe Shimeko
                    (田部シメ子)). Shimeko died, but Tsushima lived.

                    He wrote at a feverish pace and used the pen name "Osamu
                    Dazai" for the first time in a short story called "Ressha"
                    ("列車", "Train") in 1933. However, in 1935 it started to
                    become clear to Dazai that he would not graduate and after
                    failing to obtain a job he

                      Dazai also wrote a number of Novels between 1930s and

                was by no means a place of childlike simplicity where everything
                could be settled by a simple then-and-there decision.

                People talk of “social outcasts.” The words apparently denote
                the miserable losers of the world, the vicious ones, but I feel
                as though I have been a “social outcast” from the moment I was
                born. If ever I meet someone society has designated as an
                outcast, I invariably feel affection for him, an emotion which
                carries me away in melting tenderness.
